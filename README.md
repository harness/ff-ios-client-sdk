# _Installing the `ff-ios-client-sdk`_
Installing ff-ios-client-sdk is possible with `Swift Package Manager (SPM), CocoaPods and Carthage`

&nbsp;
## <u>_Swift Package Manager (SPM)_</u>
The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a dependency manager integrated into the `swift` compiler and `Xcode`.

To integrate `ff-ios-client-sdk` into an Xcode project, go to the project editor, and select `Swift Packages`. From here hit the `+` button and follow the prompts using  `https://github.com/harness/ff-ios-client-sdk.git` as the URL.

To include `ff-ios-client-sdk` in a Swift package, simply add it to the dependencies section of your `Package.swift` file. And add the product `ff-ios-client-sdk` as a dependency for your targets.

```Swift
dependencies: [
	.package(url: "https://github.com/harness/ff-ios-client-sdk.git", .upToNextMinor(from: "1.0.2"))
]
```
&nbsp;
## <u>_CocoaPods_</u>
The [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org//) CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. It has over 81 thousand libraries and is used in over 3 million apps. CocoaPods can help you scale your projects elegantly.

CocoaPods is built with Ruby and it will be installable with the default Ruby available on macOS. You can use a Ruby Version manager, however we recommend that you use the standard Ruby available on macOS unless you know what you're doing.

Using the default Ruby install will require you to use sudo when installing gems. (This is only an issue for the duration of the gem installation, though.)
```Swift
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Once cocoapods are installed, from your root project folder, create a `Podfile`, which will be located in your project's root folder, by entering the next command in your terminal:
```Swift
$ pod init
```

To import `ff-ios-client-sdk` to your `.xcproject`, simply add `ff-ios-client-sdk` to your newly created Podfile and save the Podfile changes.
```Swift
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'MyApp' do
  pod 'ff-ios-client-sdk'
end
```

Only thing left to do is to install your packages by running the next command.
```Swift
$ pod install
```
NOTE: A new `.xcworkspace` will be created and you should use that, instead of your `.xcodeproj` from now on in order to utilize the imported Pods.

## <u>_Carthage_</u>
Carthage is intended to be the simplest way to add frameworks to your Cocoa application.
Carthage builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks, but you retain full control over your project structure and setup. Carthage does not automatically modify your project files or your build settings.
In order to integrate `ff-ios-client-sdk` into your app, there are a few steps to follow.
Navigate to the root folder of your project and create a `Cartfile`. This is the file where you would input all of your dependencies that you plan to use with Carthage. You can create it by entering 
```Swift
$ touch Cartfile
``` 
in Terminal at your project's root folder. Once you open the `Cartfile`, you can copy/paste below line and save the changes.
```Swift
github "
/ff-ios-client-sdk"
```

Now, you need to run
```Swift
$ carthage update --no-build
```
This command will fetch the source for `ff-ios-client-sdk` from the repository specified in the `Cartfile`.

You will now have a new folder, named `Carthage` at the same location your `Cartfile` and your `.xcodeproj` are.
Within the `Carthage` folder, you will see another `Checkout` folder where the source code is located.
Next, we need to create a project for `ff-ios-client-sdk` dependency. We can do this easily by entering the following in the termial.
```Swift
// From your project's root folder
$ cd Carthage/Checkouts/ff-ios-client-sdk
```
followed by
```Swift
$ swift package generate-xcodeproj
```
...or, you can enter it all on the same line.
```Swift
//From your project's root folder
$ cd Carthage/Checkouts/ff-ios-client-sdk && swift package generate-xcodeproj
```
Go back into your project's root folder and enter the next command:
```Swift
$ carthage build --use-xcframeworks --platform iOS
```
This command will build the project and place it in the `Build` folder next to `Checkouts`.
On your application targetsâ€™ `General` settings tab, in the `Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content` section, drag and drop the `.xcframework` file from the `Carthage/Build` folder. In the `"Embed"` section, select `"Embed & Sign"`.

Only thing left to do is:
```Swift
import ff_ios_client_sdk
```
...wherever you need to use `ff-ios-client-sdk`

When a new version of `ff-ios-client-sdk` is available and you wish to update this dependency, run 
```Swift
$ carthage update --use-xcframeworks --platform iOS
```
And your embedded library will be updated.

# _Using the `ff-ios-client-sdk`_

In order to use `ff-ios-client-sdk` in your application, there are a few steps that you would need to take.


&nbsp;


## _Shutting down the SDK_
### <u>_destroy()_</u>
To avoid potential memory leak, when SDK is no longer needed (when the app is closed, for example), a caller should call this method.
Also, you need to call this method when changing accounts through `CfTarget` object, in order to re-initialize and fetch Evaluations for the right account.
```Swift
CfClient.sharedInstance.destroy() 
```
